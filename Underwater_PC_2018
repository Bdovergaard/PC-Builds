Looks like this one is a bit older then I remembered it. 

Tank: Aqueon LED Minibow Aquarium kit 2.5 gallon
Beginning PC: Dell Optiplex 990 SFF 
CPU: i5 2400
RAM: 4 x 4GB ddr3
Harddrive: Toshiba 1tb
GPU: AMD Radeon R5 240

Goal: Underwater PC

Initally intended to use an inspiron 3647 I had laying around to do this build but the motherboard had no chance of fitting.
Was hosting some Comptia A+ labs with friends and ended up salvaging the 990 for this project.

Tore down the PC and test fit the motherboard into the aquarium.
The motherboard conveniently left the ports just barely out of the fill line but I fabed a simple bracket to keep the motherboard in place.

I was able to screw the power supply onto the bracket and hang it on the back edge of the tank as a backpack.

The hard drive was in stuck to the side of the tank using 3m mounting tape.

I ended up putting a R5 240 i robbed from a decom machine and some network card I had laying around for mostly asthetic purposes.

I ended up deciding to leave the case fans in the tank to help move the oil around but it did wander a bit after filling.

I filled the machine with food grade mineral oil
