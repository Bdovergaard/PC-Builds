**Goal:** Don't cheap out this time.

| **Storage** | 500GB Plextor M8Pe PCIe drive + 4TB HDD |


### Build Notes

This time I was not going to fall into the same tar pit I walked into previously. I spent real money and waited much longer hunting for deals.

* **The Hardee's Deal:** I got a decent deal on the CPU/motherboard combo from a sketchy guy outside a Hardee's for $450. Although admittedly, I did end up needing to order a new motherboard about a year later.

* **The Mining Scarcity:** We were going through the first great GPU shortage at the time, so it took me quite a while to finally score one. I eventually got a brand new GTX 1080 off of a guy running a mining operation on top of a Safeway in a weird little office. Guess dude was drunk when he made the deal over the phone because he was really upset with me for showing up, but he honored the deal at $400.

* **Memory Nightmares:** The RAM I bought in two batches from Amazon at $320, which was suspiciously cheap but led to nightmares later on in the build. Apparently, something I hadn't considered was the extreme difficulty of getting something to run that fast at the time. The 4000MHz RAM was a plague on the system and would lead to random BSOD events the entire time I owned the machine; they are currently retired to the sock drawer.

* **Bleeding Edge Storage:** PCIe-based hard drives were the bleeding edge of tech. Surprisingly, this was a fairly affordable Amazon buy. I also ripped a 4TB HDD out of an old AD server I decommed previously.


### Tuning and Benchmarking

There were a couple of rebuys and tear-outs during this build as I got bit by the bug bad and had become obsessive about benchmarking. I ended up delidding the i7, going with liquid metal, and a jank custom loop made out of a cut-up All-In-One (AIO).

I think my base was a stable 4.8GHz and I could go up to 5GHz somewhat stable, but it would crash eventually at that speed. Overall, it was nice to have top 1 percent benchmarks for a bit, but not worth chasing it with dollar signs.

**5 out of 7 trains.**
