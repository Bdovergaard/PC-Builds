### Build Notes

Everyone starts somewhere, and although this wasn't my first PC, it was the first I got to tinker with and pretend to build.

Some creative liberties were taken trying to reverse engineer what parts were what as I don't have this build well documented.

The i7 was a first gen but the box said Extreme on it, the ram was definetly blue, and I am certain it was an EVGA classified motherboard.

I had recently started working in IT and other then the ole optiplex my boss gave me to field strip over and over again, I began growing hungry for a PC of my own.

After several months of stalking craigslist and the letgo app I finally found what I thought was the buy. 

Dude was selling pretty much everything but a graphics card and I picked it up for around 150-200$ which seemed like a steal compared to the prices I was seeing online.

I knew it was old stuff but it had a good following, was high end gear, and I didn't truely grasp the concept of how computers aged back then.

I was able to get the beast put together, which was both more difficult then I expected but as much of a lego project as any PC build except really heavy in comparison.


### The GPU Mistake

Unfortanately the CPU I inherited in this situation has no integrated graphics.

With great huberis, I made a second tactical error and just found the most expensive msrp graphics card I could find for the cheapest price. The Firepro v7900.

To the uninitiated, this is the equivelent to a Nvida quadro card, a buisness focused GPU that sucked so badly I wish I could go back in time and actively destroy it.


### The End of an Era

Unfortanatly this was not the only negative experience with this PC. 

Shortly after putting together and getting the GPU installed, an audible pop occured from the psu frying the system beyond recovery.

I remember it fondly.
